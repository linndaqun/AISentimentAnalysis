1191751390214930434	GavinSBaker	14) BTW – great job by the Softbank PR department. Loved the articles that noted their $400m WeWork IPO ratchet. Over $12b invested to own 80% of a company valued at sub $8b as a way to control a mark.	2019-11-11 20:14:13.967551	2019-11-05 16:17:27+00:00	0	36			
1191751383814430720	GavinSBaker	6) This lowered their average cost (i.e. invested relatively small $in WeWork at $47b and Uber at $70b), but leaves them with an unusual amount of common stock with minimal anti-dilution protection, liquidation prefs, etc. which makes them vulnerable in downside scenarios.	2019-11-11 20:14:13.967563	2019-11-05 16:17:26+00:00	1	40
